# Flipkart-GRiD-Challenge-2019

This repository contains code for my team's submission to the Flipkart GRiD â€“ Te[a]ch The Machines contest 2019 edition.

Each module is stored as a different Python class.

The huge amount of data to train the model can be found on the contest website.

Please feel free to use this code to train your models (many modules are pluggable) and suggest any improvements which should be incorporated.
